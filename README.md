# Bazaar: An Amazon Clone

Bazaar is a full-stack e-commerce web application, inspired by Amazon, designed to provide a seamless online shopping experience. This repository houses the backend code, developed using Express.js with Node.js runtime environment, and powered by MongoDB for database storage. The frontend is crafted with the robust React.js library, enhanced with essential HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bazaar leverages JWT tokens for secure authentication and utilizes Multer for efficient image uploading. The frontend boasts an appealing and user-friendly interface, prioritizing essential visual hierarchy, while the backend is designed to be robust and efficient, providing RESTful APIs for seamless interactions.
